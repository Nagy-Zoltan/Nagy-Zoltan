Hi, I'm Zoltán Nagy. I like programming basically everything. I know lot's of python, some javascript and some C++.
I'm interested in hacking, or any kind of automation where I can gain a major advantage over non-coding people by programming.
Althoug I hate hardware stuff, I can't tell apart a CPU from a RAM by looking at them physically, but I'm well aware of their 
concepts.
